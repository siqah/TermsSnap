### Project Structure

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `popup.html` - Main popup interface
- `popup.js` - Popup logic and UI updates
- `content.js` - Content script for page analysis
- `background.js` - Background script for extension functionality

- `icons/` - Extension icons in various sizes (generated)
- `generate_icons.py` - Script to generate icons in required sizes

### Icon Generation

To generate icons in all required sizes from a high-resolution source image:

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

2. Run the icon generation script with your source image:
   ```bash
   python generate_icons.py /path/to/your/icon.png
   ```

   This will create an `icons` directory with the following files:
   - `icon16.png` (16x16)
   - `icon32.png` (32x32)
   - `icon48.png` (48x48, active state)
